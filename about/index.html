<h1>About</h1>
<p>The purpose of this site will be to host a general repo of cheetsheets, practice writeups on HTB and other CTFs, and whatever else pops into mind. Creating this site, I used the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">github</a> student pack where I recieved a URL from namecheap (thanks!), a <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">guide from Jonathan McGlone</a>, colorscheme generated from <a href="https://coolors.co/">coolors.co</a>, and various other info I am forgetting to mention. Thanks for reading, and feel free to reach out at <a href="https://github.com/mmssr">github</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/volsec865">twitter</a>.</p>

Technically this is not the first post, as I created a test post while setting up Jekyll. The purpose of this site will be to host a general repo of cheetsheets I use, practice writeups on HTB and other roots, and whatever else pops into mind. Creating this site, I used the [github student pack](https://education.github.com/pack) where I recieved a URL from namecheap (thanks!) a [guide from Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), colors generated from [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/), and various other info I am forgetting to mention. My color scheme is currently using '#333333', '#999999', '#D5D5D5', '#CE7B91', and '#40798C', but that may change. Thanks for reading, and we shall see where this goes. I still need to work on my about section, and will probably update or remove the resume section as I do not believe it falls within the purview of my current site goals. Thanks for reading, and feel free to send any suggestions to <marc@mssr.me>.
